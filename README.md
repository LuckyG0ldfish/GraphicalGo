# GraphicalGo
(Just experimental) Trying to build a diagram based UI that creates Golang code

Every time when you start a new programming language there is this barrier of entry.
How to write a loop? Are bracets required! Pointers? Addressing Storage? Private/ Public? 
The basic idea behind this project is to reduce the time to start working on an project. 

To achrieve this it will try to: 
- use a GUI to allow to build a core structure 
- have a unified output that can be interepreted by packages to output whatever language the package is designed for 
- (longterm) allow for more abstract models (ERM etc.) to be input and generate code
